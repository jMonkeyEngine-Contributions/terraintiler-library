OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    A plugin library to allow jMonkeyengine games/programs to have very large terrains.\n\
    This Library will handle the loading and unloading of terrainquads that have been saved to files.\n\n\
    Once created and attached to a scene the code will hook onto a camera and try to keep a grid of tiles around it at all times. \
    Grid sizes of 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 & 9x9 are allowed and are determined only by the size of the terrains being loaded and the limits of the machine running the code.\n\n\
    Tiles are loaded from a supplied root directory in segments of 64x64 tiles\nThe current file structure is <root>/DIR-xxzz/TILE-xxzz.j3o where the x & z are the grid location.\n\
    This structure allows for up to 64x64 tiles inside up to 64x64 directories. \n\
    Giving a theoretical world of 4096x4096 tiles.\n\n\
    Being able to change the root directory also allows for multiple worlds.\n\n\
    The resulting world size is only determined by the size of each tile and the power of the machine running it.\n\n\
    Tile files are basic jME TerrainQuads with a material saved to a j3o file in the above naming convention.\n\n\
    NOTE: This library is just a loader/unloader and provides calls to get and set the properties of the tiles attached to it. \
    This library does not create tiles and will not build a world for you. \
    A "Tiled Terrain Editer/Generator" will be released soon that will provide basic terrain generation and edit functions for this library.\n\n\
    A Demo-Test case can be found at https://code.google.com/p/my-terraintiler-test/ for an example\nFor more information or assistance see the jMonkey forum post:\nhttp://jmonkeyengine.org/forum/topic/terraintiler-class-project/
